Yesterday was a statement of intent
But there are signs of a revival
It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner
But what did it matter
I think were the better side
The enemy was time
Were very close to being a good team
There is no change in the strategy

He is doing just that

It is very enjoyable
I am not retaining him
The hearing is expected to continue today

Ive never been limited on drugs
He could face a jail sentence
This gives a financial incentive to switch
He spoke about the choices facing them and their country
I cannot believe she has been admonished
I was in jail for five years
You were the kidnappers
The trial is set for February
Weve got to get it right
We are still getting signals
He said it was the worst possible result
There are simply no orders
It is time to fight a decisive battle
The hotel was now for sale
All credit to them they took their chances we didnt
Its national defence policy is defensive in nature
The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment
And now he tells us
His silence on the issue is interesting
It may mean more money but we dont need the money
Its like a garage
The move is considered a major breakthrough
Within six minutes they were two goals down
Ive taken to the hills
He now describes himself as Scottish Labour
We have fun in our lives
I had a sense of deja vu
They would be wise to do just that
Both these events occurred on Wednesday night
Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
Youll get on like a house on fire
No its actually in a block of flats
It does make a big difference
It didnt take long
It was served by sheriff officers not by the council
Is this accurate
The princess has had other health problems
It was nerveracking to watch
It is a very interesting subject
We are very concerned about controller fatigue
I in the meantime had been far from chilling
The red card was okay
Im not sure how they got there but they are
And thats good news for the magpies
We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
I see no need for change
It was a lot of hard work but it wasnt difficult
Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland
plays in dark blue
Please call Stella
There was an element of jealousy
His is a success story by any standard
They had not been handcuffed
We are not out of touch with politics
I was doing well at the hustings
We are looking for volunteers
I have no argument with Scotland
This would discourage investment and job creation
A judicial review is also being considered
No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden
I could feel the blood on my face
It was a UKwide report
Again its about responding to your resources
Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
It is a triumphant performance which defies the years
From our point of view the player is free to leave
Tonights matches European Championship
Officials say the city must achieve this
This meeting is the path to salvation
The list is too long for this piece
Id never seen a play about me
They said she had been visiting her son who is unemployed
But by that time of course it is again
Like anyone else he has to take his time
I couldnt make out what was going on
Reviving the Scottish Open is one option
You do have a way out
His name is Michael Owen
Im not going to change from it
We are not with you
And they are different
Worry can have that effect on some citizens
They are there to help us
Its terrible that this is happening
Ive got a young family
It is safe in our hands
People look but no one ever finds it
That began as an accident
My wife and family are the support system
It wasnt good but well get better
For a few years we had good fun
He will want to utilise the midfield
He said to give a local injection
You have to do your research
It is open season on the Old Firm
People dont feel safe including me
My mother is a widow
The tribunal continues today
He should be a great asset
I have spoken to the skipper
It would have been very easily done
This has got to stop
We will need to look at that
It is a gamble
We are a team of hard workers
If he does he has a real chance of gold
That should give me a chance
I was very very pleased with our display
I just need a bit of luck
He also has property interests in the country
He died the following year
There was still more disquiet in Israel
He is not a pathetic figure
It is a crucial award
They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win
It has happened and that is the end of the story
We reckon we can do very well
He pleaded for caution
His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday
It went on forever
I would rather say nothing at the moment
Maybe fulltime referees will provide the answer
And we have beaten them before
It is not easy to live in Russia
That was never their agenda
If he leaves the band is finished
You have a very persuasive president
It almost certainly is
Here we have not had one hour
We are talking about one family
As a nation we must become more active
The hotel was huge
Its about doing things
This happened on three days inside a week
I am not a fan of books
His is a success story by any standard
When it comes down to it this is a job
Its like a garage
The odds are that it will
People should make their own decisions
No one was listening
He knows the course
I dont believe in gesture politics
I am a soldier a soldier a soldier
But its not the end of Scottish football
It was totally out of the blue
We are very hopeful he will be cleared
You have been warned
This is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue
This has been very frustrating for him
We could have got three medals
The winner will be announced next month
It is however an unlikely outcome
Colonel About this committee that is coming
Where are you taking her
Well the big day has arrived
He says it often enough
There was no argument
Children also died in Britain
We told them in August
I wouldnt want to miss that chance
Of course there was still much to be done
Survival is our aim
I have hardly any commitments
That tells you something
Being a taxi driver right now is horrible
As indeed they would be
Well you can have a tree
I am not a doctor
The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
He certainly didnt say he was a journalist
Once they go away they wont come back
He is the saviour of South Africa
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow
Actually it turned out to be the concerto
He said he would appeal the sentences
The service from the other players was super
I go in for the parts
Frankly the party was not being honest with itself
Surely they were on a hiding to nothing
Each one is as good as the other
He too was unlucky not to get a goal
That was a good effort
But thats another story for another day
We were with him the whole time
She is a valuable member of Government
Im going to win the gold
They have not been named
He is lying to save his skin
It is up to Ann
He had finally had enough
It had been played at festivals
Its still got that at its heart
I would love to play in Europe again
Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
She really suffered for her art
Ive got to get noticed
The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
Obviously people are worried in the West Midlands
We can only go up
Is a drug dealer
I hope that that will be forthcoming
I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland
Were not comparing like with like
It is now being examined
Next league matches Motherwell Dundee United
The body follows the mind
I must take a seat
That never came to court as a charge
The matter will come up again
We dont do this for everyone of course
And if he hasnt become a musician
If so they were wrong
In the end we did not spend a penny on him
Is that not uncanny
Its always the same isnt it
Ive got a long way to go
Dancing was her life
Two others were also seriously injured
I am about protecting the state pension
We are all suffering
I had troubles with the producers
I love the feel of the place
He is helping police with their inquiries
Our positions remains unchanged
Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the suns rays by the rain
The answer is maybe
I had no intention of misleading anyone
It was not a coverup
It is so out of character
But when we do it it is great
You know the sort of thing
Only one got through
The latter way is my way
And there is another problem
The hearing was fair
Please call Stella
Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
It may take time to get it back
I was influenced by all of these things
Thats the only thing that matters
I believe in debate and dialogue
He was a one off
The decision is purely down to the clinic
That is the theory
They made such decisions in London
The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
I didnt understand it
He died later in hospital
And you know something
It is one of those things
She can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
It just isnt a defining issue for them
The second aspect was the fear of failure
I read it every year
I started on fire a couple of times
Or so it is hoped
Is it the flight
After this they were always in the driving seat
On the other hand the poster did not help
But it might have done
It is all in the mind
We did not complete the process
I knew people on that committee
It was a matter of chance
Its really good fun
Entries from the event are still being accepted
But experience is a wonderful thing
But its been kept to a minimum
What was this
That had not happened on this occasion
Thankfully there were no reports of anything serious
One thing is sure
A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland
Then came the crunch
It is a real concern
Last night the company could not be contacted
The children continue to talk to us
Strictly speaking it shouldnt be like this
There were too many mistakes
It is par for the course of course
The error appeared in a warrant
Of course it is a tough assignment
The talking cannot go on too long
Hes got the same story
It is a traffic warden
Actually nothing much will change
I am looking forward to getting home
That will just be the beginning
It was good today
I told that to the police
I will report in the spring
Green is desperate to play on The Open
It makes no influence on the public
Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect
The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
Tenants will be unable to defend themselves
I cannot believe this decision
The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
That is the position the MoD has adopted
They will be up for it for sure
That was the theory anyway
Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
Weve all been here before
The call was ignored
There is no point of looking any further
I am ready to go
We are still suffering from that
We had to take action to protect them
It should be the reverse
Do they have to create seven majors
We must learn to finish
Six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
This decision is destroying my family
It is though the law is not clear cut
Im just delighted to take it
He is trying really hard
Are his works inside out
Is something which we just dont do
This is an internal matter
It is ambitious but it can be achieved
He has the edge
We could learn a lot from them
It always had to be about the gym
I expect a rapid response
It is my last chance
Ive done nothing wrong and thats the truth
There is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end
The weather forecast isnt good
Funding needs to be long term
This is the logic of punishment assaults
HARRY Potter has lost his magic
The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of superimposition of a number of bows
This was never a support group
The script was funny
But lets not get ahead of ourselves
I have to take some of the blame
What can you do
These things have not happened by accident
They were at school together
In the end however it all came together
Scotland doesnt even have a target
It comes down to the police in England
It is a beautiful country
However my position remains the same
As it was a double it was pretty expensive
There is always the smell
Thats what were trying to achieve
That idea is rubbish
The players are obviously keen to do well
Footage has been passed on to the police
We should keep this recent assault in perspective
They will have five minutes to decide
He is a visionary
And so it goes on
What on earth is happening to rugby
We did discuss the Lockerbie issue
Theres a hint of classical
That is a question for the next manager
Its ahead of Labour
I have no doubt about that
It has been a magical moment
Its funny how it comes and goes
I expected a victory the pain is enormous
Because its a secret
But we cant have a casino
Would they work together again
We are not going to get carried away
The role was a knockout but really difficult
Its the whole package
She is currently in foster care
He has really done well
Horses are not affected
The dictator of Iraq is not disarming
She has not returned to work
I can feel the sound inside
Theyve been wonderful to me
We want to get there
The answer is yes
The hearing was expected to last six weeks
Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
This was not a summit about the euro
On reflection it was really quite exciting
We played too deeply
So far the scheme has not been used in Scotland
Our thoughts are with her
Not that it was needed
Many others are subjected to violence by men
The service will only survive with change
Painful but only because its true
Staff have been informed
Everything is so new
There is no room for error
Ill go to the races
It may well have been
He had a decision to make
He took away my childhood
I didnt actually work up a speech
After that time the market itself will set the prices
The referee had a shocking game
So it took me back to boarding school
We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
So you let me know
They were going through the motions but thats about all
He had a great game
If he could have prevented it happening he would have
At the moment Michael is in a class of his own
That is a personal matter
These days are over
Which he is too
I could not sit in the stands
When a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
It is time he said
It has been a great day
To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
That was the easy election
You take a risk
Men should avoid it like the plague
I am looking forward to this film
He can do no wrong
That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty
The clarity is vital
I am not a paedophile
No one can say that about me
I was totally wrong
I will work on her
But not all were so defiant
Otherwise we would all pay the price
The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday
She went home from school and never returned
Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
Sub Not Used McArthur
It has been handled entirely properly
I havent been able to do it since
Its up to them to decide
Nor is it likely to do so
Strikers like to go to the ground
Everyone believes in it
That has proved to be a lasting lesson
There is no formula
A compromise is essential
He didnt let me down
I shall be voting Yes to support him
They really shouldnt have put it out
All the pressure will be on him
That is really all
They need to be involved
He must not be removed from office
Again we were lucky
Why is that
But he kept on repeating it
I cannot say too much about them
The princess has had other health problems
We will turn the corner
We played them off the pitch
He saw it all as a big game
We will be back next year
Both sides have been hit by injury
If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow
We are at the crossroads
I cant believe the buzz
We are expecting a big crowd
Sure that already happens in New Zealand
He really has everything including a beautiful swing
It was just awful
The warning was lifted late last night
But hes a very quiet man
We are seeking a meeting with the Minister
I had a son
I really want to win in Glasgow
They made a huge impression on me
It won the match
You will be very very welcome
Do not listen to them
I was not fit enough and it showed
When he got up he was hit again
Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
I was close enough
The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
Its great fun to get to act
It was too soon
And there are some interesting conductors too
We will see how he is
It lasted longer than we thought
It does and it doesnt
It is part of their job
It was very very frightening
This takes the pressure off
Why has it taken so long
This is a oneoff
What can you say
It is sponsored by The Herald
I love a clever reader
I said How much
He just attracted people
We welcome the ministers decision
He has gone back to school
We deserved to get the victory today
We are not leaving the area
The concept is simple
I am really really happy
It was very moving actually
It was just one man
Our nation has been changed by this event
Thats where it all started
It is so beautiful
We dont know what is happening to them
The car driver was not injured
I put the drawing down
I hope that doesnt happen
Destruction came from within
The airspace above the theatre was closed off
We must not give in to bastards
Prime minister Blair is not that way
The principle is quite clear
Is it a warning to parents
Im delighted for the lads
I have been here for only three months
He liked to talk
Ferguson had done his homework
I am very encouraged by this poll
I had no choice
You make the choice
That can happen so easily
Its not their fault
He was at the game and he is indeed
And now he has decided enough
Now they have to do something about it
This is as bad as it gets
We want him to continue that way
I dont think it is the case
His arrival could be the making of them
Everyone would have been happy
We could do a lot worse
There is no hiding place
I chose the former
The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
Allison is not convinced
This is a horrible loss
It would be a bonus for this game
One is too many
That would be a big step forward
There is nothing wrong with that
It is suitable and sensible
On recent evidence he will not be missed
Ive got nothing to say
This has been fantastic
This means that our programme is quite unusual
Last season was very hard for me
Six spoons of fresh snow peas five thick slabs of blue cheese and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
The real issue is personal
It was really surprising
Israeli forces denied the claim
FIRST we had the Battle of Britain
This is perfectly legal
We want to know about the policy
I believe in having difficult times
It is still holding good today
Im not interested in money
This is very good news
Noone knows the numbers
It was good to score the goal today
So it was in politics
There will be no exceptions to this rule
Sub Not Used McKee
The state is controlled by the left
But this has already been rejected
The president took offence
It is not the fault of one man of course
Its an old story
This is a very common type of bow one showing mainly red and yellow with little or no green or blue
It is a victory to that extent
The matter has been reported to the police
This was repeated the second time
I can live with that
This was a massive result for us
It has paid off
I learned that only yesterday
Since then it has become a tradition
I see no need to change
Im looking forward to racing Donovan
Its part of your life
Everything is surrounded by confusion
You would be wrong
To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
It was a long time coming
For many it had become a fact of life
We just have to improve
He felt there was no case to answer
They were very responsive
I believe it would have been successful
Thats the last thing he will do
Is that not pathetic
I am happy to be here
There will be no disruption in the schools
Or so we thought
Perhaps it was her demeanour
It was the rugby writers dinner in London
It was then that Rangers scored
We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
I didnt have the choice
Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
I can handle the pace
Mr Wallace was unimpressed
We were completely outplayed
We are at war
Ive seen it work already
I will be trying to do better tomorrow
Thankfully they liked it
Theyve got more time
People look but no one ever finds it
It was a definite penalty
We do know the reaction of the SAC
It hasnt worked out that way
It isnt a freeforall
The family is so happy for him
Id never have called a doctor for myself
I would say so
Is he any good
It was something special
You are always aware of the injury potential
It does not take much
We try to keep it right
It will not be today though
The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
That suggests that out fitness is good
The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of superimposition of a number of bows
They were assured that it would
The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
Our children are our future
Were not either of those things
We just need the Government to act
What do you think they said
Its not in my nature
But he did not rule out further talks
He had a horror
When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air they act as a prism and form a rainbow
Nature will not find its own level
Its a good story
They have not seen her for years
Were talking to him
Its happened but its a dream
Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
Partly it is his own fault
The timing is wrong
We have to get on with it
This time it was not be
This decision is a victory for common sense
I know we ask a lot of you
Its all happening at a local level
Success in Scotland is important
The casting of her husband was an accident
Who is he
What do you do
Despite that it was a great day for me
The money all appears to be gone
This could be the case
Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow
Horses have some sense
I really feel sorry for the Irish
That is how the Farmer is feeling today
The trial will open today
Mr Blair defended his wife
There was nothing anyone could do
It was all over for us then
I thought it was the only way out
I certainly hope so
We just do not do it
Onethird of the places are already taken
You will never replace the child
We can do it
Who will take them after that
It had happened to him
Police have refused to name the couple involved
It was an important part of the course
When a man looks for something beyond his reach his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
You see this business is a good one
She can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
I have got to keep the lid on
It would be dangerous to resign
Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
Clearly the future remains uncertain
He made no comment
The couple had one daughter
We have no knowledge of this
England will be under a lot of pressure
Noone has spoken to me
It was a surprising decision
That is our business
I dont know where it went
It requires a wider team
What do you do
It would also delay the Scottish results
The attitude was good today
And thats the trouble with this business
He wanted to talk to me about it
Visiting fans were banned from attending the game
New investment will be openly tendered
He leaves a beat
It is not a matter of concern
There are two offerings from Scotland
In many ways it was disastrous
It shouldnt be a problem
Our legal advice is clear
He was extremely ill
Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
Do you mean today
The outcome is now in our own hands
There is according to legend a boiling pot of gold at one end
There is no doubt about that
We are keen to have him back
It goes in cycles
Its going to be tough
It is not illegal
He deserves a top team
The man has already had too many chances
Our destiny is in our own hands
Longterm it was the right thing to do
I was the willing journeyman
I love you so very much
The hearing continues today
Its not going to work
The post will be unpaid
But he has a lifeline
Its better to be happy
This one would have been
I could not believe the results
Scotland needs to hear it too
It has been a great success
I would say the risk is very small
I dont entirely buy that
PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines
He will be fine
I knew the script
She died later on Monday
Our commitment is to move forward
I know the worry over Iraq
He dismissed the action
That would be a big mistake
We must do that
Colin Cameron was excellent
It was a nightmare
Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the suns rays by the rain
I dont want to use the term
And there are different perspectives
Thats why he is a national treasure
Stand by for action
We suspect he was pleased
A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday
If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow
But this is just the first step
But was it really so big
But at the moment there isnt the budget
Lots of others were doing the same
It was just great
I support the stand that they are making
It is an absolute disgrace
They are unable to say anything
The proposals have been taken out of context
So what did he do
Ive had six days of rehearsal
Please call Stella
Its very very frustrating
These take the shape of a long round arch with its path high above and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
Scotland were on Saturday
But it didnt happen
He deserved that much
We want to get there
It was a management problem in the hospital
Surely the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
What do we do
His second was a beauty
If you can run a computer you can talk to the world
We are not interested in dividends
Does the name matter
He was asked to quit
We will deliver at director level
They are difficult awards to decide
And does it
At the moment we do not know the extent of their injuries
The force is with them
Sadly the revival could not be sustained
I cant even get into the A team
However the devil is in the detail
Two other men including the taxi driver were wounded in the attack
It is not a story
What do we want to do that for
In fact he is not even in the squad for the game
Every one is a winner
I got a great response from the players as I had expected
It is on the internet
However they continued in their pursuit of victory
I have never been a member of the council
I have had a good life
We have an election in eight days
But it is different in different regions
And we can do it
The performance is not there
I was released after six days
Seriously we are not concerned at all
We want this place to work
To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods 
Frankly we were lucky to get second
So did she meet him
Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks
Do you think were a top nation
If thats the case he will struggle
Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways 
Until recently she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
It depends on Labour not on us
In light of things I think I made the right decision
They have to be addressed
The world is a good place
How independent is that
We have to be very very careful
It is a crisis of human rights a crisis of leadership
So what is the campaign about
What form did that take
The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases 
It is simply not true
We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids 
Overall we continue to look to the future with confidence
The matter is under appeal
And its a goodbye from him
He called for a public inquiry
But we will have to wait
However the bank denied that he was in the running
Much of the equipment was new
It should be a condition of employment
The market is appalling for initial public offerings
Everything happened so quickly that we were taken by surprise
Police said the family was helping with the search
The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain 
Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically 
Still he did not let himself down this week
In many ways that is as important
So is that it then
In this case the farmer had actually given permission
This could be a mistake
He has become a monster
Part of the complex is historic
Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed 
His concern is only for the future
Inside the atmosphere was quiet
When we looked at the company
It is the strength of the school
They have set the standard
The statement contained no surprises
The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted
The company still had the confidence of its bankers he said
I am delighted for them
Frankly it was worth the booking
She was there for the start of the campaign
I am not interested in the money it is the principle
On the night it was not enough
Were not seeing an image of the person he said
Our action is not the end but the beginning of a process
Is there a waiting list
It is all starting to come together
The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson the foreign office minister
She is not a victim
On the outside of an airport it is very difficult
It starts with the script
Alice the girl was said by doctors to be in good condition
It depends on the decisions of the member states
That could be a mistake
He suffered a broken back and other injuries
All of the management has invested in the firm
However he said the money had not been wasted
That admission is not surprising
But it was also hard
That is the lesson of the last three weeks
However it is not as simple as this
He looks as if he could be worth the risk
While they went on holiday we got the contract
He is a good friend
If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band since red and green light when mixed form yellow 
He was good but not that good
Is our children learning
It was sold at a loss
It has to be enforced
Scotland won by six wickets
The players were under pressure
We do not have the papers
Why do you want to come to Edinburgh
This is a central issue
I was always in control
And they were being paid
Three days later he was killed
She does not want to speak
He had no money left to run the club
The strategy is not without risk
Tony Blair has had a good conference
Was everything done to save people
In fact he should never have been in the field
But after a dip in sales growth was recorded
However we will obviously keep the matter under review
Indeed it is only the beginning
There is no common ground
In that case the children were not missing
That is the nature of the game
But it may not be all bad news
Please call Stella 
Her experience is certainly limited
She can scoop these things into three red bags and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station

I saw a big game
She bought a red door
They enjoyed hot tea
We found a cool ladder
He ate a tall lemon
I made a warm muffin
She served a sweet treat
They watched a rare ring
I caught a bad dog
He grabbed a big gift
I read a dated deed
She took a tight toast
They prepared a sweet taco
We organized a grand dance
I enjoyed a cool lamp
He fixed a quick clock
They had a warm meal
I took a tight train
She drove a sleek kayak

We watched a true train
I enjoyed a deep poem
They heard a firm murmur
I ate a cheap pie
He took a tasty toast
She caught a dark dog
She wrote a tight tale
He held a hot hat
She had a quick kick
He had a slick kite
They enjoyed a sweet song
He cooked a tasty tart
I enjoyed a rare rib
He held a tall lion
